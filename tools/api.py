Only return a JSON object with a single key "query", whose value is a list of natural language questions derived from the document.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
Document: (--)-alpha-Bisabolol has a primary antipeptic action depending on dosage, which is not caused by an alteration of the pH-value. The proteolytic activity of pepsin is reduced by 50 percent through addition of bisabolol in the ratio of 1/0.5. The antipeptic action of bisabolol only occurs in case of direct contact. In case of a previous contact with the substrate, the inhibiting effect is lost.

EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT:
{
    "query": [
        "What is the antipeptic effect of (--)-alpha-bisabolol?",
        "How does (--)-alpha-bisabolol affect pepsin activity?",
        "Does (--)-alpha-bisabolol change the pH to inhibit pepsin?",
        "What dosage of (--)-alpha-bisabolol is effective for antipeptic action?",
        "Why is direct contact necessary for (--)-alpha-bisabolol to inhibit pepsin?",
        "What happens when (--)-alpha-bisabolol is applied after substrate exposure?",
        "What is the mechanism behind (--)-alpha-bisabololâ€™s inhibition of proteolytic activity?"
